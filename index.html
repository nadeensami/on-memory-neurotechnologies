      <p>
        The year is 2035. Pat is a 72-year old woman. She has a husband, two
        adult children, and three grandkids. For 30 years she worked as a
        librarian, but she retired 7 years ago and has volunteered three days
        per week at the local animal shelter ever since. Recently, she started
        mixing up the times of her shifts at the shelter. Her family also began
        to notice her repeating questions like, “what’s everyone doing this
        weekend?” within a short period of time. After a trip to her GP and a
        referral to a Neurologist, Pat is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.

        It’s hard to imagine yourself in Pat’s shoes but for many of us,
        Alzheimer’s disease will affect our lives in some way. It is estimated
        that 5.8 million Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer’s disease.
        With such a high prevalence, it’s likely that Alzheimer’s will touch
        your life whether it’s a parent, grandparent, spouse, another loved one,
        or yourself.

        Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia-related memory loss are the focus
        of an entire research field, and scientists are working every day to not
        only understand dementia, but also find ways to preserve and restore
        memories in dementia patients. In the year 2050, memory prostheses like
        the one Dr. Singh mentioned to Pat might be commonplace. Right now,
        scientists are working to make that future a reality. One example comes
        from the [name of Dong’s lab] at the University of Southern California.

        Over the next two years, Pat (now aged 74) experiences more advanced
        symptoms of AD. She starts to have trouble recalling her children’s
        names when she chats with them and sometimes forgets who she is speaking
        with. She is also beginning to need help with daily functioning tasks
        like choosing her clothes in the morning, and remembering to eat. Pat’s
        husband provides her with daily support for these tasks and he reports
        that, “some days are better than others.”

        Over the next five years, Pat (now aged 79) shows further AD-related
        decline. Her family notices that she’s “not acting like herself.” On
        several occasions, Pat has accused her husband of having an affair. She
        has also made some inappropriate remarks to her 10 y.o. granddaughter.
        After these moments of agitation, Pat seems to “go back to normal” as if
        nothing has happened. Problems with changes in personality, such as what
        Pat is facing, may soon be addressed by commercial neurotech Personality
