      <h2>Meet Pat</h2>
      <p>
        The year is 2035. Pat is a 72-year old woman. She has a husband, two
        adult children, and three grandkids. For 30 years she worked as a
        librarian, but she retired 7 years ago and has volunteered three days
        per week at the local animal shelter ever since. Recently, she started
        mixing up the times of her shifts at the shelter. Her family also began
        to notice her repeating questions like, “what’s everyone doing this
        weekend?” within a short period of time. After a trip to her GP and a
        referral to a Neurologist, Pat is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.
